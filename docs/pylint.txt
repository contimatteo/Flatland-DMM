Pylint global options and switches
----------------------------------

Pylint provides global options and switches.

General options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:init-hook:
  Python code to execute, usually for sys.path manipulation such as
  pygtk.require().
:errors-only:
  In error mode, checkers without error messages are disabled and for others,
  only the ERROR messages are displayed, and no reports are done by default.
:py3k:
  In Python 3 porting mode, all checkers will be disabled and only messages
  emitted by the porting checker will be displayed.
:verbose:
  In verbose mode, extra non-checker-related info will be displayed.
:ignore:
  Add files or directories to the blacklist. They should be base names, not
  paths.

  Default: ``CVS``
:ignore-patterns:
  Add files or directories matching the regex patterns to the blacklist. The
  regex matches against base names, not paths.
:persistent:
  Pickle collected data for later comparisons.

  Default: ``yes``
:load-plugins:
  List of plugins (as comma separated values of python module names) to load,
  usually to register additional checkers.
:fail-under:
  Specify a score threshold to be exceeded before program exits with error.

  Default: ``10.0``
:jobs:
  Use multiple processes to speed up Pylint. Specifying 0 will auto-detect the
  number of processors available to use.

  Default: ``1``
:unsafe-load-any-extension:
  Allow loading of arbitrary C extensions. Extensions are imported into the
  active Python interpreter and may run arbitrary code.
:limit-inference-results:
  Control the amount of potential inferred values when inferring a single
  object. This can help the performance when dealing with large functions or
  complex, nested conditions.

  Default: ``100``
:extension-pkg-whitelist:
  A comma-separated list of package or module names from where C extensions may
  be loaded. Extensions are loading into the active Python interpreter and may
  run arbitrary code.
:suggestion-mode:
  When enabled, pylint would attempt to guess common misconfiguration and emit
  user-friendly hints instead of false-positive error messages.

  Default: ``yes``
:exit-zero:
  Always return a 0 (non-error) status code, even if lint errors are found.
  This is primarily useful in continuous integration scripts.
:from-stdin:
  Interpret the stdin as a python script, whose filename needs to be passed as
  the module_or_package argument.
:long-help:
  more verbose help.

Commands options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:rcfile:
  Specify a configuration file to load.
:help-msg:
  Display a help message for the given message id and exit. The value may be a
  comma separated list of message ids.
:list-msgs:
  Generate pylint's messages.
:list-msgs-enabled:
  Display a list of what messages are enabled and disabled with the given
  configuration.
:list-groups:
  List pylint's message groups.
:list-conf-levels:
  Generate pylint's confidence levels.
:list-extensions:
  List available extensions.
:full-documentation:
  Generate pylint's full documentation.
:generate-rcfile:
  Generate a sample configuration file according to the current configuration.
  You can put other options before this one to get them in the generated
  configuration.
:generate-man:
  Generate pylint's man page.

Messages control options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:confidence:
  Only show warnings with the listed confidence levels. Leave empty to show
  all. Valid levels: HIGH, INFERENCE, INFERENCE_FAILURE, UNDEFINED.
:enable:
  Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can
  either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option
  multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where
  it should appear only once). See also the "--disable" option for examples.

  Default: ``c-extension-no-member``
:disable:
  Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You
  can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this
  option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration
  file where it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to
  disable everything first and then reenable specific checks. For example, if
  you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all
  --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have
  no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes
  --disable=W".

  Default: ``print-statement,parameter-unpacking,unpacking-in-except,old-raise-syntax,backtick,long-suffix,old-ne-operator,old-octal-literal,import-star-module-level,non-ascii-bytes-literal,raw-checker-failed,bad-inline-option,locally-disabled,file-ignored,suppressed-message,useless-suppression,deprecated-pragma,use-symbolic-message-instead,apply-builtin,basestring-builtin,buffer-builtin,cmp-builtin,coerce-builtin,execfile-builtin,file-builtin,long-builtin,raw_input-builtin,reduce-builtin,standarderror-builtin,unicode-builtin,xrange-builtin,coerce-method,delslice-method,getslice-method,setslice-method,no-absolute-import,old-division,dict-iter-method,dict-view-method,next-method-called,metaclass-assignment,indexing-exception,raising-string,reload-builtin,oct-method,hex-method,nonzero-method,cmp-method,input-builtin,round-builtin,intern-builtin,unichr-builtin,map-builtin-not-iterating,zip-builtin-not-iterating,range-builtin-not-iterating,filter-builtin-not-iterating,using-cmp-argument,eq-without-hash,div-method,idiv-method,rdiv-method,exception-message-attribute,invalid-str-codec,sys-max-int,bad-python3-import,deprecated-string-function,deprecated-str-translate-call,deprecated-itertools-function,deprecated-types-field,next-method-defined,dict-items-not-iterating,dict-keys-not-iterating,dict-values-not-iterating,deprecated-operator-function,deprecated-urllib-function,xreadlines-attribute,deprecated-sys-function,exception-escape,comprehension-escape``

Reports options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
:output-format:
  Set the output format. Available formats are text, parseable, colorized, json
  and msvs (visual studio). You can also give a reporter class, e.g.
  mypackage.mymodule.MyReporterClass.

  Default: ``text``
:reports:
  Tells whether to display a full report or only the messages.
:evaluation:
  Python expression which should return a score less than or equal to 10. You
  have access to the variables 'error', 'warning', 'refactor', and 'convention'
  which contain the number of messages in each category, as well as 'statement'
  which is the total number of statements analyzed. This score is used by the
  global evaluation report (RP0004).

  Default: ``10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10)``
:score:
  Activate the evaluation score.

  Default: ``yes``
:msg-template:
  Template used to display messages. This is a python new-style format string
  used to format the message information. See doc for all details.

  Used when a function / class / method is redefined.
:continue-in-finally (E0116): *'continue' not supported inside 'finally' clause*
  Emitted when the `continue` keyword is found inside a finally clause, which
  is a SyntaxError. This message can't be emitted when using Python >= 3.8.
:abstract-class-instantiated (E0110): *Abstract class %r with abstract methods instantiated*
  Used when an abstract class with `abc.ABCMeta` as metaclass has abstract
  methods and is instantiated.
:star-needs-assignment-target (E0114): *Can use starred expression only in assignment target*
  Emitted when a star expression is not used in an assignment target.
:duplicate-argument-name (E0108): *Duplicate argument name %s in function definition*
  Duplicate argument names in function definitions are syntax errors.
:return-in-init (E0101): *Explicit return in __init__*
  Used when the special class method __init__ has an explicit return value.
:too-many-star-expressions (E0112): *More than one starred expression in assignment*
  Emitted when there are more than one starred expressions (`*x`) in an
  assignment. This is a SyntaxError.
:nonlocal-and-global (E0115): *Name %r is nonlocal and global*
  Emitted when a name is both nonlocal and global.
:used-prior-global-declaration (E0118): *Name %r is used prior to global declaration*
  Emitted when a name is used prior a global declaration, which results in an
  error since Python 3.6. This message can't be emitted when using Python <
  3.6.
:return-outside-function (E0104): *Return outside function*
  Used when a "return" statement is found outside a function or method.
:return-arg-in-generator (E0106): *Return with argument inside generator*
  Used when a "return" statement with an argument is found outside in a
  generator function or method (e.g. with some "yield" statements). This
  message can't be emitted when using Python >= 3.3.
:invalid-star-assignment-target (E0113): *Starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple*
  Emitted when a star expression is used as a starred assignment target.
:bad-reversed-sequence (E0111): *The first reversed() argument is not a sequence*
  Used when the first argument to reversed() builtin isn't a sequence (does not
  implement __reversed__, nor __getitem__ and __len__
:nonexistent-operator (E0107): *Use of the non-existent %s operator*
  Used when you attempt to use the C-style pre-increment or pre-decrement
  operator -- and ++, which doesn't exist in Python.
:yield-outside-function (E0105): *Yield outside function*
  Used when a "yield" statement is found outside a function or method.
:init-is-generator (E0100): *__init__ method is a generator*
  Used when the special class method __init__ is turned into a generator by a
  yield in its body.
:misplaced-format-function (E0119): *format function is not called on str*
  Emitted when format function is not called on str object. e.g doing
  print("value: {}").format(123) instead of print("value: {}".format(123)).
  This might not be what the user intended to do.
:nonlocal-without-binding (E0117): *nonlocal name %s found without binding*
  Emitted when a nonlocal variable does not have an attached name somewhere in
  the parent scopes
:lost-exception (W0150): *%s statement in finally block may swallow exception*
  Used when a break or a return statement is found inside the finally clause of
  a try...finally block: the exceptions raised in the try clause will be
  silently swallowed instead of being re-raised.
:assert-on-tuple (W0199): *Assert called on a 2-item-tuple. Did you mean 'assert x,y'?*
  A call of assert on a tuple will always evaluate to true if the tuple is not
  empty, and will always evaluate to false if it is.
:assert-on-string-literal (W0129): *Assert statement has a string literal as its first argument. The assert will %s fail.*
  Used when an assert statement has a string literal as its first argument,
  which will cause the assert to always pass.
:self-assigning-variable (W0127): *Assigning the same variable %r to itself*
  Emitted when we detect that a variable is assigned to itself
:comparison-with-callable (W0143): *Comparing against a callable, did you omit the parenthesis?*
  This message is emitted when pylint detects that a comparison with a callable
  was made, which might suggest that some parenthesis were omitted, resulting
  in potential unwanted behaviour.
:nan-comparison (W0177): *Comparison %s should be %s*
  Used when an expression is compared to NaNvalues like numpy.NaN and
  float('nan')
:dangerous-default-value (W0102): *Dangerous default value %s as argument*
  Used when a mutable value as list or dictionary is detected in a default
  value for an argument.
:duplicate-key (W0109): *Duplicate key %r in dictionary*
  Used when a dictionary expression binds the same key multiple times.
:useless-else-on-loop (W0120): *Else clause on loop without a break statement*
  Loops should only have an else clause if they can exit early with a break
  statement, otherwise the statements under else should be on the same scope as
  the loop itself.
:expression-not-assigned (W0106): *Expression "%s" is assigned to nothing*
  Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing.
  Probably something else was intended.
:confusing-with-statement (W0124): *Following "as" with another context manager looks like a tuple.*
  Emitted when a `with` statement component returns multiple values and uses
  name binding with `as` only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as
  a, b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager
  returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context
  manager.
:unnecessary-lambda (W0108): *Lambda may not be necessary*
  Used when the body of a lambda expression is a function call on the same
  argument list as the lambda itself; such lambda expressions are in all but a
  few cases replaceable with the function being called in the body of the
  lambda.
:assign-to-new-keyword (W0111): *Name %s will become a keyword in Python %s*
  Used when assignment will become invalid in future Python release due to
  introducing new keyword.
:redeclared-assigned-name (W0128): *Redeclared variable %r in assignment*
  Emitted when we detect that a variable was redeclared in the same assignment.
:pointless-statement (W0104): *Statement seems to have no effect*
  Used when a statement doesn't have (or at least seems to) any effect.
:pointless-string-statement (W0105): *String statement has no effect*
  Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect).
  This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily
  disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of
  comments.
:unnecessary-pass (W0107): *Unnecessary pass statement*
  Used when a "pass" statement that can be avoided is encountered.
:unreachable (W0101): *Unreachable code*
  Used when there is some code behind a "return" or "raise" statement, which
  will never be accessed.
:eval-used (W0123): *Use of eval*
  Used when you use the "eval" function, to discourage its usage. Consider
  using `ast.literal_eval` for safely evaluating strings containing Python
  expressions from untrusted sources.
:exec-used (W0122): *Use of exec*
  Used when you use the "exec" statement (function for Python 3), to discourage
  its usage. That doesn't mean you cannot use it !
:using-constant-test (W0125): *Using a conditional statement with a constant value*
  Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) uses a constant value
  for its test. This might not be what the user intended to do.
:missing-parentheses-for-call-in-test (W0126): *Using a conditional statement with potentially wrong function or method call due to missing parentheses*
  Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) seems to wrongly call
  a function due to missing parentheses
:literal-comparison (R0123): *Comparison to literal*
  Used when comparing an object to a literal, which is usually what you do not
  want to do, since you can compare to a different literal than what was
  expected altogether.
:comparison-with-itself (R0124): *Redundant comparison - %s*
  Used when something is compared against itself.
:non-ascii-name (C0144): *%s name "%s" contains a non-ASCII unicode character*
  Used when the name contains at least one non-ASCII unicode character.
:invalid-name (C0103): *%s name "%s" doesn't conform to %s*
  Used when the name doesn't conform to naming rules associated to its type
  (constant, variable, class...).
:blacklisted-name (C0102): *Black listed name "%s"*
  Used when the name is listed in the black list (unauthorized names).
:singleton-comparison (C0121): *Comparison %s should be %s*
  Used when an expression is compared to singleton values like True, False or
  None.
:misplaced-comparison-constant (C0122): *Comparison should be %s*
  Used when the constant is placed on the left side of a comparison. It is
  usually clearer in intent to place it in the right hand side of the
  comparison.
:empty-docstring (C0112): *Empty %s docstring*
  Used when a module, function, class or method has an empty docstring (it
  would be too easy ;).
:missing-class-docstring (C0115): *Missing class docstring*
  Used when a class has no docstring.Even an empty class must have a docstring.
:missing-function-docstring (C0116): *Missing function or method docstring*
  Used when a function or method has no docstring.Some special methods like
  __init__ do not require a docstring.
:missing-module-docstring (C0114): *Missing module docstring*
  Used when a module has no docstring.Empty modules do not require a docstring.
:unidiomatic-typecheck (C0123): *Using type() instead of isinstance() for a typecheck.*
  The idiomatic way to perform an explicit typecheck in Python is to use
  isinstance(x, Y) rather than type(x) == Y, type(x) is Y. Though there are
  unusual situations where these give different results.

Exceptions checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``exceptions``.

Exceptions checker Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:overgeneral-exceptions:
  Exceptions that will emit a warning when being caught. Defaults to
  "BaseException, Exception".

  Default: ``BaseException,Exception``

Exceptions checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:bad-except-order (E0701): *Bad except clauses order (%s)*
  Used when except clauses are not in the correct order (from the more specific
  to the more generic). If you don't fix the order, some exceptions may not be
  caught by the most specific handler.
:catching-non-exception (E0712): *Catching an exception which doesn't inherit from Exception: %s*
  Used when a class which doesn't inherit from Exception is used as an
  exception in an except clause.
:bad-exception-context (E0703): *Exception context set to something which is not an exception, nor None*
  Used when using the syntax "raise ... from ...", where the exception context
  is not an exception, nor None.
:notimplemented-raised (E0711): *NotImplemented raised - should raise NotImplementedError*
  Used when NotImplemented is raised instead of NotImplementedError
:raising-bad-type (E0702): *Raising %s while only classes or instances are allowed*
  Used when something which is neither a class, an instance or a string is
  raised (i.e. a `TypeError` will be raised).
:raising-non-exception (E0710): *Raising a new style class which doesn't inherit from BaseException*
  Used when a new style class which doesn't inherit from BaseException is
  raised.
:misplaced-bare-raise (E0704): *The raise statement is not inside an except clause*
  Used when a bare raise is not used inside an except clause. This generates an
  error, since there are no active exceptions to be reraised. An exception to
  this rule is represented by a bare raise inside a finally clause, which might
  work, as long as an exception is raised inside the try block, but it is
  nevertheless a code smell that must not be relied upon.
:duplicate-except (W0705): *Catching previously caught exception type %s*
  Used when an except catches a type that was already caught by a previous
  handler.
:broad-except (W0703): *Catching too general exception %s*
  Used when an except catches a too general exception, possibly burying
  unrelated errors.
:raise-missing-from (W0707): *Consider explicitly re-raising using the 'from' keyword*
  Python 3's exception chaining means it shows the traceback of the current
  exception, but also the original exception. Not using `raise from` makes the
  traceback inaccurate, because the message implies there is a bug in the
  exception-handling code itself, which is a separate situation than wrapping
  an exception.
:raising-format-tuple (W0715): *Exception arguments suggest string formatting might be intended*
  Used when passing multiple arguments to an exception constructor, the first
  of them a string literal containing what appears to be placeholders intended
  for formatting
:binary-op-exception (W0711): *Exception to catch is the result of a binary "%s" operation*
  Used when the exception to catch is of the form "except A or B:". If
  intending to catch multiple, rewrite as "except (A, B):"
:wrong-exception-operation (W0716): *Invalid exception operation. %s*
  Used when an operation is done against an exception, but the operation is not
  valid for the exception in question. Usually emitted when having binary
  operations between exceptions in except handlers.
:bare-except (W0702): *No exception type(s) specified*
  Used when an except clause doesn't specify exceptions type to catch.
:try-except-raise (W0706): *The except handler raises immediately*
  Used when an except handler uses raise as its first or only operator. This is
  useless because it raises back the exception immediately. Remove the raise
  operator or the entire try-except-raise block!

Refactoring checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``refactoring``.

Refactoring checker Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:max-nested-blocks:
  Maximum number of nested blocks for function / method body

  Default: ``5``
:never-returning-functions:
  Complete name of functions that never returns. When checking for
  inconsistent-return-statements if a never returning function is called then
  it will be considered as an explicit return statement and no message will be
  printed.

  Default: ``sys.exit``

Refactoring checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:simplifiable-condition (R1726): *Boolean condition '%s' may be simplified to '%s'*
  Emitted when a boolean condition is able to be simplified.
:condition-evals-to-constant (R1727): *Boolean condition '%s' will always evaluate to '%s'*
  Emitted when a boolean condition can be simplified to a constant value.
:simplify-boolean-expression (R1709): *Boolean expression may be simplified to %s*
  Emitted when redundant pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
:consider-using-in (R1714): *Consider merging these comparisons with "in" to %r*
  To check if a variable is equal to one of many values,combine the values into
  a tuple and check if the variable is contained "in" it instead of checking
  for equality against each of the values.This is faster and less verbose.
:consider-merging-isinstance (R1701): *Consider merging these isinstance calls to isinstance(%s, (%s))*
  Used when multiple consecutive isinstance calls can be merged into one.
:super-with-arguments (R1725): *Consider using Python 3 style super() without arguments*
  Emitted when calling the super() builtin with the current class and instance.
  On Python 3 these arguments are the default and they can be omitted.
:consider-using-dict-comprehension (R1717): *Consider using a dictionary comprehension*
  Emitted when we detect the creation of a dictionary using the dict() callable
  and a transient list. Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this
  code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a dict comprehension.Also
  it is faster since you don't need to create another transient list
:consider-using-generator (R1728): *Consider using a generator instead '%s(%s)'*
  If your container can be large using a generator will bring better
  performance.
:consider-using-set-comprehension (R1718): *Consider using a set comprehension*
  Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to
  read and can be simplified to a set comprehension.Also it is faster since you
  don't need to create another transient list
:consider-using-get (R1715): *Consider using dict.get for getting values from a dict if a key is present or a default if not*
  Using the builtin dict.get for getting a value from a dictionary if a key is
  present or a default if not, is simpler and considered more idiomatic,
  although sometimes a bit slower
:consider-using-join (R1713): *Consider using str.join(sequence) for concatenating strings from an iterable*
  Using str.join(sequence) is faster, uses less memory and increases
  readability compared to for-loop iteration.
:consider-using-sys-exit (R1722): *Consider using sys.exit()*
  Instead of using exit() or quit(), consider using the sys.exit().
:consider-using-ternary (R1706): *Consider using ternary (%s)*
  Used when one of known pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.
:consider-swap-variables (R1712): *Consider using tuple unpacking for swapping variables*
  You do not have to use a temporary variable in order to swap variables. Using
  "tuple unpacking" to directly swap variables makes the intention more clear.
:trailing-comma-tuple (R1707): *Disallow trailing comma tuple*
  In Python, a tuple is actually created by the comma symbol, not by the
  parentheses. Unfortunately, one can actually create a tuple by misplacing a
  trailing comma, which can lead to potential weird bugs in your code. You
  should always use parentheses explicitly for creating a tuple.
:stop-iteration-return (R1708): *Do not raise StopIteration in generator, use return statement instead*
  According to PEP479, the raise of StopIteration to end the loop of a
  generator may lead to hard to find bugs. This PEP specify that raise
  StopIteration has to be replaced by a simple return statement
:inconsistent-return-statements (R1710): *Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should.*
  According to PEP8, if any return statement returns an expression, any return
  statements where no value is returned should explicitly state this as return
  None, and an explicit return statement should be present at the end of the
  function (if reachable)
:redefined-argument-from-local (R1704): *Redefining argument with the local name %r*
  Used when a local name is redefining an argument, which might suggest a
  potential error. This is taken in account only for a handful of name binding
  operations, such as for iteration, with statement assignment and exception
  handler assignment.
:chained-comparison (R1716): *Simplify chained comparison between the operands*
  This message is emitted when pylint encounters boolean operation like"a < b
  and b < c", suggesting instead to refactor it to "a < b < c"
:simplifiable-if-expression (R1719): *The if expression can be replaced with %s*
  Used when an if expression can be replaced with 'bool(test)'.
:simplifiable-if-statement (R1703): *The if statement can be replaced with %s*
  Used when an if statement can be replaced with 'bool(test)'.
:too-many-nested-blocks (R1702): *Too many nested blocks (%s/%s)*
  Used when a function or a method has too many nested blocks. This makes the
  code less understandable and maintainable.
:no-else-break (R1723): *Unnecessary "%s" after "break"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a break statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a break statement.
:no-else-continue (R1724): *Unnecessary "%s" after "continue"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a continue statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a continue statement.
:no-else-raise (R1720): *Unnecessary "%s" after "raise"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a raise statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a raise statement.
:no-else-return (R1705): *Unnecessary "%s" after "return"*
  Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if
  containing a return statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an
  else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a return statement.
:unnecessary-comprehension (R1721): *Unnecessary use of a comprehension*
  Instead of using an identity comprehension, consider using the list, dict or
  set constructor. It is faster and simpler.
:use-a-generator (R1729): *Use a generator instead '%s(%s)'*
  Comprehension inside of 'any' or 'all' is unnecessary. A generator would be
  sufficient and faster.
:useless-return (R1711): *Useless return at end of function or method*
  Emitted when a single "return" or "return None" statement is found at the end
  of function or method definition. This statement can safely be removed
  because Python will implicitly return None
:unneeded-not (C0113): *Consider changing "%s" to "%s"*
  Used when a boolean expression contains an unneeded negation.
:consider-iterating-dictionary (C0201): *Consider iterating the dictionary directly instead of calling .keys()*
  Emitted when the keys of a dictionary are iterated through the .keys()
  method. It is enough to just iterate through the dictionary itself, as in
  "for key in dictionary".
:consider-using-enumerate (C0200): *Consider using enumerate instead of iterating with range and len*
  Emitted when code that iterates with range and len is encountered. Such code
  can be simplified by using the enumerate builtin.
:len-as-condition (C1801): *Do not use `len(SEQUENCE)` without comparison to determine if a sequence is empty*
  Used when Pylint detects that len(sequence) is being used without explicit
  comparison inside a condition to determine if a sequence is empty. Instead of
  coercing the length to a boolean, either rely on the fact that empty
  sequences are false or compare the length against a scalar.

Stdlib checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``stdlib``.

Stdlib checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:invalid-envvar-value (E1507): *%s does not support %s type argument*
  Env manipulation functions support only string type arguments. See
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv.
:bad-open-mode (W1501): *"%s" is not a valid mode for open.*
  Python supports: r, w, a[, x] modes with b, +, and U (only with r) options.
  See https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#open
:invalid-envvar-default (W1508): *%s default type is %s. Expected str or None.*
  Env manipulation functions return None or str values. Supplying anything
  different as a default may cause bugs. See
  https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv.
:redundant-unittest-assert (W1503): *Redundant use of %s with constant value %r*
  The first argument of assertTrue and assertFalse is a condition. If a
  constant is passed as parameter, that condition will be always true. In this
  case a warning should be emitted.
:shallow-copy-environ (W1507): *Using copy.copy(os.environ). Use os.environ.copy() instead.*
  os.environ is not a dict object but proxy object, so shallow copy has still
  effects on original object. See https://bugs.python.org/issue15373 for
  reference.
:boolean-datetime (W1502): *Using datetime.time in a boolean context.*
  Using datetime.time in a boolean context can hide subtle bugs when the time
  they represent matches midnight UTC. This behaviour was fixed in Python 3.5.
  See https://bugs.python.org/issue13936 for reference. This message can't be
  emitted when using Python >= 3.5.
:deprecated-method (W1505): *Using deprecated method %s()*

  Python. Consider looking for an alternative in the documentation.
:subprocess-popen-preexec-fn (W1509): *Using preexec_fn keyword which may be unsafe in the presence of threads*
  The preexec_fn parameter is not safe to use in the presence of threads in
  your application. The child process could deadlock before exec is called. If
  you must use it, keep it trivial! Minimize the number of libraries you call
  into.https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor
:subprocess-run-check (W1510): *Using subprocess.run without explicitly set `check` is not recommended.*
  The check parameter should always be used with explicitly set `check` keyword
  to make clear what the error-handling behavior
  is.https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run
:bad-thread-instantiation (W1506): *threading.Thread needs the target function*
  The warning is emitted when a threading.Thread class is instantiated without
  the target function being passed. By default, the first parameter is the
  group param, not the target param.

  argument passed for formatting doesn't contain or doesn't have that key as an
  attribute.


Typecheck checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``typecheck``.

Typecheck checker Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:ignore-on-opaque-inference:
  This flag controls whether pylint should warn about no-member and similar
  checks whenever an opaque object is returned when inferring. The inference
  can return multiple potential results while evaluating a Python object, but
  some branches might not be evaluated, which results in partial inference. In
  that case, it might be useful to still emit no-member and other checks for
  the rest of the inferred objects.

  Default: ``yes``
:ignore-mixin-members:
  Tells whether missing members accessed in mixin class should be ignored. A
  mixin class is detected if its name ends with "mixin" (case insensitive).

  Default: ``yes``
:ignore-none:
  Tells whether to warn about missing members when the owner of the attribute
  is inferred to be None.

  Default: ``yes``
:ignored-modules:
  List of module names for which member attributes should not be checked
  (useful for modules/projects where namespaces are manipulated during runtime
  and thus existing member attributes cannot be deduced by static analysis). It
  supports qualified module names, as well as Unix pattern matching.
:ignored-classes:
  List of class names for which member attributes should not be checked (useful
  for classes with dynamically set attributes). This supports the use of
  qualified names.

  Default: ``optparse.Values,thread._local,_thread._local``
:generated-members:
  List of members which are set dynamically and missed by pylint inference
  system, and so shouldn't trigger E1101 when accessed. Python regular
  expressions are accepted.
:contextmanager-decorators:
  List of decorators that produce context managers, such as
  contextlib.contextmanager. Add to this list to register other decorators that
  produce valid context managers.

  Default: ``contextlib.contextmanager``
:missing-member-hint-distance:
  The minimum edit distance a name should have in order to be considered a
  similar match for a missing member name.

  Default: ``1``
:missing-member-max-choices:
  The total number of similar names that should be taken in consideration when
  showing a hint for a missing member.

  Default: ``1``
:missing-member-hint:
  Show a hint with possible names when a member name was not found. The aspect
  of finding the hint is based on edit distance.

  Default: ``yes``
:signature-mutators:
  List of decorators that change the signature of a decorated function.

:keyword-arg-before-vararg (W1113): *Keyword argument before variable positional arguments list in the definition of %s function*
  When defining a keyword argument before variable positional arguments, one
  can end up in having multiple values passed for the aforementioned parameter
  in case the method is called with keyword arguments.
:non-str-assignment-to-dunder-name (W1115): *Non-string value assigned to __name__*
  Emitted when a non-string vaue is assigned to __name__
:arguments-out-of-order (W1114): *Positional arguments appear to be out of order*
  Emitted when the caller's argument names fully match the parameter names in
  the function signature but do not have the same order.
:isinstance-second-argument-not-valid-type (W1116): *Second argument of isinstance is not a type*
  Emitted when the second argument of an isinstance call is not a type.
:c-extension-no-member (I1101): *%s %r has no %r member%s, but source is unavailable. Consider adding this module to extension-pkg-whitelist if you want to perform analysis based on run-time introspection of living objects.*
  Used when a variable is accessed for non-existent member of C extension. Due
  to unavailability of source static analysis is impossible, but it may be
  performed by introspecting living objects in run-time.


Variables checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verbatim name of the checker is ``variables``.

Variables checker Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:init-import:
  Tells whether we should check for unused import in __init__ files.
:dummy-variables-rgx:
  A regular expression matching the name of dummy variables (i.e. expected to
  not be used).

  Default: ``_+$|(_[a-zA-Z0-9_]*[a-zA-Z0-9]+?$)|dummy|^ignored_|^unused_``
:additional-builtins:
  List of additional names supposed to be defined in builtins. Remember that
  you should avoid defining new builtins when possible.
:callbacks:
  List of strings which can identify a callback function by name. A callback
  name must start or end with one of those strings.

  Default: ``cb_,_cb``
:redefining-builtins-modules:
  List of qualified module names which can have objects that can redefine
  builtins.

  Default: ``six.moves,past.builtins,future.builtins,builtins,io``
:ignored-argument-names:
  Argument names that match this expression will be ignored. Default to name
  with leading underscore.

  Default: ``_.*|^ignored_|^unused_``
:allow-global-unused-variables:
  Tells whether unused global variables should be treated as a violation.

  Default: ``yes``

Variables checker Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
:unpacking-non-sequence (E0633): *Attempting to unpack a non-sequence%s*
  Used when something which is not a sequence is used in an unpack assignment
:invalid-all-object (E0604): *Invalid object %r in __all__, must contain only strings*
  Used when an invalid (non-string) object occurs in __all__.
:no-name-in-module (E0611): *No name %r in module %r*
  Used when a name cannot be found in a module.
:undefined-variable (E0602): *Undefined variable %r*
  Used when an undefined variable is accessed.
:undefined-all-variable (E0603): *Undefined variable name %r in __all__*
  Used when an undefined variable name is referenced in __all__.
:used-before-assignment (E0601): *Using variable %r before assignment*
  Used when a local variable is accessed before its assignment.
:cell-var-from-loop (W0640): *Cell variable %s defined in loop*
  A variable used in a closure is defined in a loop. This will result in all
  closures using the same value for the closed-over variable.
:global-variable-undefined (W0601): *Global variable %r undefined at the module level*
  Used when a variable is defined through the "global" statement but the
  variable is not defined in the module scope.
:self-cls-assignment (W0642): *Invalid assignment to %s in method*
  Invalid assignment to self or cls in instance or class method respectively.
:unbalanced-tuple-unpacking (W0632): *Possible unbalanced tuple unpacking with sequence%s: left side has %d label(s), right side has %d value(s)*
  Used when there is an unbalanced tuple unpacking in assignment
:possibly-unused-variable (W0641): *Possibly unused variable %r*
  Used when a variable is defined but might not be used. The possibility comes
  from the fact that locals() might be used, which could consume or not the
  said variable
:redefined-builtin (W0622): *Redefining built-in %r*
  Used when a variable or function override a built-in.
:redefine-in-handler (W0623): *Redefining name %r from %s in exception handler*
  Used when an exception handler assigns the exception to an existing name
:redefined-outer-name (W0621): *Redefining name %r from outer scope (line %s)*
  Used when a variable's name hides a name defined in the outer scope.
:unused-import (W0611): *Unused %s*
  Used when an imported module or variable is not used.
:unused-argument (W0613): *Unused argument %r*
  Used when a function or method argument is not used.
:unused-wildcard-import (W0614): *Unused import %s from wildcard import*
  Used when an imported module or variable is not used from a `'from X import
  *'` style import.
:unused-variable (W0612): *Unused variable %r*
  Used when a variable is defined but not used.
:global-variable-not-assigned (W0602): *Using global for %r but no assignment is done*
  Used when a variable is defined through the "global" statement but no
  assignment to this variable is done.
:undefined-loop-variable (W0631): *Using possibly undefined loop variable %r*
  Used when a loop variable (i.e. defined by a for loop or a list comprehension
  or a generator expression) is used outside the loop.
:global-statement (W0603): *Using the global statement*
  Used when you use the "global" statement to update a global variable. Pylint
  just try to discourage this usage. That doesn't mean you cannot use it !
:global-at-module-level (W0604): *Using the global statement at the module level*
  Used when you use the "global" statement at the module level since it has no
  effect
